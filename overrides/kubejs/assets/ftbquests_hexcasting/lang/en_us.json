Like many mods, Hexcasting &lisn't&r for everyone!\n\nThis questline mostly serves as an impetus for those unaware of the mod, to get your mind spinning with its &enear-limitless&r possibilities.\n\n&6Staves&r are your core tool, they're how you open the &dHex Grid&r to cast on.\n\nThe &6Hex Notebook&r is the mod's own form of documentation. Its &dPatterns section&r is an excellent reference for all the different Patterns available.
